# Project Statement: Basic Subscription Manager

## Problem Statement
In the modern digital age, individuals often subscribe to multiple recurring services such as streaming platforms, software tools, and gym memberships. It is easy to lose track of the cumulative cost of these small monthly fees, leading to unintentional budget overruns. Users need a straightforward, quick, and distraction-free tool to input their active subscriptions and immediately visualize their total monthly financial commitment without setting up complex spreadsheet software.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is limited to a CLI (Command Line Interface) based application developed in Python.
* **In-Scope:**
    * Accepting user input for subscription names and associated costs.
    * Validating numerical inputs to prevent errors (e.g., negative costs or text where numbers are expected).
    * Storing data temporarily during the runtime session using Python lists.
    * Displaying a formatted summary of all entries.
    * Calculating the total monthly expenditure.
* **Out-of-Scope:**
    * Persistent database storage (data is lost when the program closes).
    * Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    * Categorization of expenses or date tracking.

## Target Users
* **Students:** Who need to manage limited
